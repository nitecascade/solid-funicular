There are two software packages here:

1. C implementation of the Louvain Community Detection Algorithm, downloaded
   from::

    https://sourceforge.net/projects/louvain/

  which will create::

    louvain-generic.tar.gz

  See also: https://sites.google.com/site/findcommunities/

2. Python module that uses the C implementation. Clone it from the Mercurial
   repo::

    $ hg clone https://bitbucket.org/taynaud/python-louvain


To build the C implementation
-----------------------------

If there is no *./build/* directory here, create one::

    $ mkdir build

Unpack the tarball and move it to *./build/*::

    $ tar zxvf louvain-generic.tar.gz
    $ mv louvain-generic build

Build the software within the *./build/* dir::

    $ cd build
    $ make

The executables are::

    ./build/convert
    ./build/hierarchy
    ./build/louvain


To install the Python module
----------------------------

Instead of installing *python-louvain* as a Python module, the *env.sh*
file at the root of this repo adds it to *PYTHONPATH*. This avoids
installing a third party package into the Conda env that Conda does
not know about.

To build the documentation for *python-louvain*
...............................................

Install *numpydoc* and *sphinx* using *conda*::

    $ conda install numpydoc sphinx
    $ cd python-louvain/docs
    $ make

To run the tests for *python-louvain*
.....................................

Install *nose* using *conda*::

    $ conda install nose
    $ cd python-louvain
    $ python setup.py test

Usage
.....

[This is taken from *python-louvain/README* and modified slightly.]

The command line program is in::

    python-louvain/bin/community

Run it with::

    $ python-louvain/bin/community <filename>

filename is a binary file as generated by the *convert* utility distributed
with the C implementation

To use as a python library::

    import community

(Remember that *PYTHONPATH* must contain the path to *python-louvain*, and that
this is set up by *env.sh* at the root of this repo.)
